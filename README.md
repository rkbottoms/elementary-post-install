# elementary-post-install
Script for configuring a fresh install of elementary OS

This script depends on my dotfiles configuration. Currently it clones [my dotfiles](https://github.com/rkbottoms/dotfiles) to configure git, bash, fonts and sublime text 3. You are free to download/fork and use them but make sure to change the sections that set up my git username, email address, and ssh key. You can also use your own dotfiles if you want but remember to change the address git clones in the script.
